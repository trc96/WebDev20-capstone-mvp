# CAPSTONE IDEA: 

My idea for my capstone project is a sort of family reunion photo dump. This comes from my experience with house fires and losing photos and other articles that result in lost memories. I married into a rather large family that does annual reunions and I want to provide an organized online platform that allows those photos to be accessed from anywhere.

# MVPs:

-Account Authentication for different experiences based on credentials.

-Picture presentation in a "tile" like format, similar to instagram.

-Users will be able to upload photos that will display in the "tile" format.

# Additional Features:

-When clicking on a photo, present it modally with a description that the user will be able to input with the upload.

-Provide tiers of authentication(one to view, one to view and upload).
